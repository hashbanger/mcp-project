    "summary": "Large language model powered autonomous agents demand robust, standardized\nprotocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and coordinate tasks\nacross heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale,\nsecure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent\ncommunication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication\nProtocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol\n(ANP), each addressing interoperability in deployment contexts. MCP provides a\nJSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data\nexchange. ACP defines a general-purpose communication protocol over RESTful\nHTTP, supporting MIME-typed multipart messages and synchronous and asynchronous\ninteractions. Its lightweight and runtime-independent design enables scalable\nagent invocation, while features like session management, message routing, and\nintegration with role-based and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). A2A enables\npeer-to-peer task delegation using capability-based Agent Cards, supporting\nsecure and scalable collaboration across enterprise agent workflows. ANP\nsupports open network agent discovery and secure collaboration using W3C\ndecentralized identifiers DIDs and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared\nacross multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms,\ncommunication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis,\na phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access,\nfollowed by ACP for structured, multimodal messaging session-aware interaction\nand both online and offline agent discovery across scalable, HTTP-based\ndeployments A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for\ndecentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation\nfor designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered\nagents.",

Then,\nthe security of this protocol is formally proved using the game-based model.\nFinally, we perform the comparison between this protocol and other related\nworks.",

    "summary": "Replication protocols are essential for distributed systems, ensuring\nconsistency, reliability, and fault tolerance. Traditional Crash Fault Tolerant\n(CFT) protocols, which assume a fail-stop model, are inadequate for untrusted\ncloud environments where adversaries or software bugs can cause Byzantine\nbehavior. Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols address these threats but\nface significant performance, resource overheads, and scalability challenges.\nThis paper introduces Recipe, a novel approach to transforming CFT protocols to\noperate securely in Byzantine settings without altering their core logic.\nRecipe rethinks CFT protocols in the context of modern cloud hardware,\nincluding many-core servers, RDMA-capable networks, and Trusted Execution\nEnvironments (TEEs). The approach leverages these advancements to enhance the\nsecurity and performance of replication protocols in untrusted cloud\nenvironments. Recipe implements two practical security mechanisms, i.e.,\ntransferable authentication and non-equivocation, using TEEs and\nhigh-performance networking stacks (e.g., RDMA, DPDK). These mechanisms ensure\nthat any CFT protocol can be transformed into a BFT protocol, guaranteeing\nauthenticity and non-equivocation. The Recipe protocol consists of five key\ncomponents: transferable authentication, initialization, normal operation, view\nchange, and recovery phases. The protocol's correctness is formally verified\nusing Tamarin, a symbolic model checker. Recipe is implemented as a library and\napplied to transform four widely used CFT protocols-Raft, Chain Replication,\nABD, and AllConcur-into Byzantine settings. The results demonstrate up to 24x\nhigher throughput compared to PBFT and 5.9x better performance than\nstate-of-the-art BFT protocols. Additionally, Recipe requires fewer replicas\nand offers confidentiality, a feature absent in traditional BFT protocols.",

    "summary": "The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI\napplications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,\nwhere diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey\nprovides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\nas a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level\nadaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established\nliterature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward\nMCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions\nto standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy\ncovering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,\nintegration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal\nthree key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of\nisolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables\nsemantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration\nparadigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap\npositioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,\nand intelligent transport infrastructures.",
